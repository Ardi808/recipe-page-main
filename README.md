## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- `@font-face` custom fonts

### What I learned

Through this challenge I learned how to:

- Use **CSS custom properties** for consistent color and theme management.
- Apply **@font-face** to load and use custom fonts locally.
- Structure semantic HTML with sections for preparation, ingredients, instructions, and nutrition.
- Combine **Flexbox** (for centering) and **Grid** (for nutrition table) effectively.
- Create a **responsive design** using a mobile-first workflow and media queries.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, better alt text for images).
- Explore more responsive typography with clamp().
- Add subtle animations or transitions to make the UI more interactive.
